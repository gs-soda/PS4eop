So lets say you want to mod a save file or use someone elses save file well you can't do it on a retail ps4 but the emulator unlocked the save file encryption key, a encryption
key is used on retail ps4s to stop people from using other save files from other people and modifying save files but you may know a program called ps4 save wizard that decrpyts the file
but you have to pay for it and we want a free emulator with everything possible so we removed the encryption and we have a built in save editor in the emulator for free!
so you can have fun and try new things out and when we get the trophy system working you can unlock all the trophys. And thanks for supporting our project
