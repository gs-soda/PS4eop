So optimization is a key thing we want to include in our emulator so if you have similar specs to the PS4 you can have a great time
and if you have a very powerful computer you are going to still have a great experience. So we have chose the hardware optimization route
instead of the size optimization so the emulator may be large but will be very smooth and overall you are going to have a great experience.
We are seeing the emulator to be about 20 gigabytes without games, that's large but we want hardware optimization
and since we went hardware optimization there is going to be more games you can play.
