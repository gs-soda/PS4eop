So we have got more people onboard on the development of ps4eop right now we are calling it ps4eop but it will change for legal reasons.
But we now have a team of very experienced developers, We got 9 New people on this project so now there is 11 people working everyday on this emulator
so you will get hands on this emulator a lot faster, Thanks Everyone for supporting and the help.
We are making a program to write out errors in the emulator to fix the errors a lot faster and we have made special error codes so we know what the problem
is. We never thought we would get this much people curious on this emulator.
