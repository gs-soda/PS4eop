so the ps4 has ps2 emulation but i was never used and i made a ps2 emulator before and me and jack go it imported and i can play ps2 and ps4 games the emulator will have a site to go to
for all the ps2 games that work which is every ps2 game lol, so we have a ps4 emulator that runs on reasonable hardware and we are very happy on how its going!
