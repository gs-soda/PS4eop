No we keep trying to record with obs and obs streamlabs but they crash when we start recording and when we upload pictures with proof they disapear we don't know why
but it's not going our way but we can ensure you that this is not fake and is real we are sorry for the disconvience but we can't control everything
we are trying to figure out why obs and obs streamlabs keep crashing when the emulator is running we can show you the files but thats not 100% proof 
for all the people saying it's fake well you will see it's not fake and will surprise everyone, theres me and my friend jack working on this so it will take sometime 
we want to release the emulator when we know its stable enough and right now theres not alot to the emulator so all we can do is keep working on this
we have put alot of time and money into this emulator to be released for free, so if you ever want to support us you will be able to get your hands on this emulator right now
bu for the public we want it to be stable, like we keep saying we will give you a video on the files to show how its working but like we said obs keeps crashing when the
emulator is running and right now we also only have it running on windows 10 64 bit we also want to expand it to windows 8 and 8.1 along with 32 bit systems and linux
we are also making a linux os that is this ps4 emulator for people that want a pc turned completely into a ps4, But Thanks for the support
