so we have tested over 300 systems with all types of different hardware and here is the minimum and Recommended hardware below

Mininmum Specs
Processer: Intel Core i5 4430 = AMD FX-8350
Memory: 8gb 1332 Mhz (Single Stick)
Graphics Card: AMD Radeon HD 7990 = Nvidia GTX 690
Storage: 40gb

Recommended Specs
Processer: Intel Core i7 4790K = AMD Ryzen 3 2200G
Memory: 16gb 2933 Mhz (Dual Slot Memory)
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 = AMD Radeon R9 390
Storage: 60gb

The emulator is very optimize and if you have a ps4 running linux this emulator will run just like your on a ps4 but you can run at different resolutions and graphic settings
and we are trying to bring down the size of the emulator.
