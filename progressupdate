 Hey Sorry for the news but ps4eop is being stopped for some time we thank all of you supporting us, my dream was to be a developer and a professional csgo player and i want to try something different for some time but ps4eop will be worked on but me and my son are moving and i'm dealing with some life issues and we wont have the money to support this project and people bringing this project down i think its time to move on, i cant have more people bringing the project down i need some time to think about it but i may change my mind, my son is dealing with bullying issues im dealing with medical issues its not good
